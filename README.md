1. Intro
The Github holds a program for a Food Waste App! The app's goal is to connect local food businesses that want to sell their food waste inventory to hungry customers looking for their favorite meals at a discount. By turning potential waste into "Surprise Bags," we help the environment, reduce the food that buisnesses throw away, and satisfy the community.


2. Problem
The Challenge of having a Surplus of food Every day is that the amount tends to be unpredictable. As a result, perfectly good food is thrown away because businesses cannot accurately predict daily demand.

- The Business Problem: Stores lose revenue on unsold inventory.

- The Environmental Problem: Food waste contributes significantly to global CO2 emissions.

- The Satisfaction Problem: recomending many customers will leave some customers dissatisfied, ruining their trust in the food buisness and the app.

- As a solution, An algorithm will be made to find the best local optimal solution.



3. Our Program
The project is built as a modular simulation environment to test different marketplace strategies.

- Simulator:
  The engine that runs daily cycles, manages customer behavior, and tracks inventory across multiple days.

- The Store & Customer Objects: Data models that track location (Lat/Long), ratings, and personalized valuations.

- The Algorithm Suite: A collection of different recommendation strategies:

   * Greedy Baseline: A simple "top-rated" sorter.

   * The one big algorithm that we are still working on

 
4. Development of the Main algorithm

- Done by having all 4 members brainstorm and write 4 algorithms that best solve the problem

  * running the 4 algorithms through the same simulation

  * Using the results/data, run through a graph

  * Select the 2 best algorithms accordding to Revenue effecency, then combine them into one algirihtm


5. Solution
